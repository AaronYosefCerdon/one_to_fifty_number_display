#Initialize a list to serve as a counter for each given range.

#Start a loop that will ask the user to input numbers.

#Ask the user to input numbers from 1 to 50.

#Use an if statement to give a condition only numbers 1 to 50 are accepted.

#Define each counter into 5 different ranges where each input will fall in.

#Use an else statement to print an error message when an input is invalid and break the loop.

#Print the counts for each interval defined.
